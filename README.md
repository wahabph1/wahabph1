### Hello! 👋 I'm Abdul Wahab

🌱 I'm a student studying Software Engineering and learning to become a MERN Developer (that's MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). Right now, I'm focusing on React JS, which helps me build cool web stuff.

📚 I really like writing too. I write articles about tech stuff to help explain things better. It's like telling a story about how technology works.

🚀 I'm super curious about making computer programs and websites that people find useful. I want to make things that look good and work well.

🤝 I'm friendly and I'd love to chat about coding, projects, or anything tech-related. You can reach me here: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdul-wahab-shaikh-0b3757260) 

Keep coding, keep learning, and keep trying new things! 🚀👨‍💻
